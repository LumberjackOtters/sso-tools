      <p>Develop and fully test out your applications with single sign-on to radically improve your offering for <strong>enterprise customers</strong>.</p>

        <p>Use the SSO Tools sandbox to quickly spin-up identity providers, register users and set-up your service providers in order to test the entire SSO lifecycle.</p>
        <p>You don't need to worry about signing up for complicated SSO providers, and <strong>you don't even need an account to get started</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Personalised and secure</h2>
        <p>Each of your identity providers is given its own path at our IdP subdomain, allowing you to easily separate different IdP configurations for testing different functions.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Emulate a real-world IdP</h2>
        <p>SSO Tools allows you to run a typical IdP environment. Users associated with your provider can locally login to list your connected applications to test the login and logout flows.</p>
        <p>Support for both IdP and SP initiated sign-on is available, allowing you to test your applications under typical enterprise SSO usage. For example, if one of your customers has a link to sign-in to your app from their local intranet.</p>

        <h2>Follow industry standards</h2>
        <p>SSO Tools allows you to test your SSO implementations in your apps following protocols and standards used by the vast majority of large companies, educational institutions, government agencies, and more.</p>
        <p>We currently support the SAML2 protocol, which works well with your customers using LDAP and/or Microsoft Active Directory. Each IdP you create can have different settings to enable you to fully test out your services and your multi-tenancy support.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">SSO Tools is created and maintained by a solo developer. During my work as part of a growing startup selling enterprise SaaS, the need for providing larger organisations with federated authentication became hugely important.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">I spent a lot of my spare time reading-up and learning about the different approaches to SSO via SAML2, with a focus on security whilst also making set-up easy for our customers.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">In my spare time I began working on SSO Tools so that I could easily test sign-on and logout flows across different use-cases.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">SSO Tools is free and open-source software, and you can <a href='https://git.wilw.dev/wilw/sso-tools' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>check out the source code</a> if you are interested. <strong>I hope you find it useful!</strong></p>
